# Roster2.0
This repo will contain updates made to an existing course repo, the roster repo

When returning to the original roster project, I discovered holes that were in classes that are dependent on input being placed in a certain way.
The point of this repository is to fix as many holes as they come up to improve the functionality of the roster project.
Problems that will be reworked are codes that rely on students being displayed in a certain way based on how the user wants to display the students.
  New methods: void displayOptions in the RosterIO class
  Revised methods: void run in the RosterIO class (so that the new display method is implemented)
